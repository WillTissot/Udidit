# Udidit
This project was completed during Udacity's nanodegree in postgreSQL. 


I had to undestand the database base schema from a social app with users who can make posts and comment.

I revised the db schema by creating more table following all the rules of normalization.

Lastly, I migrated the old data into the new tables.
